# Cisco-DLEP-Radio-Simulator
The purpose of this software source code repository is to provide a test tool to assist a potential integrator who intends to create a MANET (Mobile Ad hoc Networking) Radio System intended to work with the Cisco 5900 series Embedded Services Router.

When compiled, it provides a simulated radio link that implements Dynamic Link Exchange Protocol (DLEP) â€“ RFC 8175 as an actual MANET radio would.
 
RFC 8175 is published here: https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8175
